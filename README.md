# Tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe, also known as "X and O" or "Noughts and Crosses," is a classic and widely recognized two-player game. It is a simple yet engaging game that is often played on a grid of 3x3 squares, making it an ideal choice for quick fun or strategical thinking.


# Game Objective:
The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with three of their symbols, either "X" or "O," on the game board.

# How to Play:

1. Game Setup: Tic Tac Toe is typically played on a 3x3 grid. Two players participate in the game, and each player takes turns placing their symbol ("X" or "O") on an empty cell of the grid.

2. Taking Turns: Players take turns placing their symbol on the grid. The first player is usually "X," and the second player is "O." The goal is to create a line of three of their symbols in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

3. Game Progression: As the game progresses, players use strategy to block their opponent from forming a line while also attempting to create their own winning combination.

4. Winning: The game ends when a player successfully forms a line of three of their symbols. That player is declared the winner.

5. Draw: If all the cells on the grid are filled, and neither player has achieved a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
